# iostress

ðŸš€ Blast your Socket.IO server with this quick and powerful JavaScript testing tool!

> [!WARNING]
> Unstable! Don't use in production stage.

## Mission

- Flexible and Easy to Use API
- Lightweight
- Socket.IO specific stress test library
- Covers complex scenarios
- Accurate statistics

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install iostress
```

```bash
$ pnpm add iostress
```

```bash
$ yarn add iostress
```

## Get Started

iostress separates test config and scenarios logics. So you usually end up with this kind of folder structure:

```plain
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ test.js
â”œâ”€â”€ low-pressure.scenario.js
â””â”€â”€ high-pressure.scenario.js
```

You're configuration (`test.js`) file may look like this:

```javascript
const stressTest = new IOStress({
  target: 'http://localhost:3000',
  phases: [
    {
      name: 'Low Pressure',
      minClients: 10,
      maxClients: 100,
      rampDelayRate: 500,
      scenarioInitializer: (clientNumber) => {
        return { extraHeaders: { token: clientNumber } };
      },
      scenarioPath: join(__dirname, 'low-pressure.scenario.js'),
      scenarioTimeout: 20000,
    },
    {
      name: 'More Pressure',
      minClients: 100,
      maxClients: 1000,
      rampDelayRate: 100,
      scenarioInitializer: (clientNumber) => {
        return { extraHeaders: { token: clientNumber } };
      },
      scenarioPath: join(__dirname, 'high-pressure.scenario.js'),
    },
  ],
});

stressTest.run();
```

And this is how your scenario file may look like:

```javascript
const sleep = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

const scenario = async (socket, logger) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    await sleep(10);
    socket.emit('ping', (data) => {
      logger.log(`Received: ${data}`);
      if (i === 99) {
        setTimeout(() => {
          socket.disconnect(); // announce iostress, scenario execution finished
        }, 1000);
      }
    });
  }
};

export default scenario;
// if you're using cjs: module.exports = scenario;
```

## How to Use

### Configuration

iostress exports a single class `IOStress` to configure your stress test behavior:

```typescript
interface IOStressInterface {
  new (options: IOStressOptions): IOStress;

  run: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

```typescript
interface IOStressOptions {
  target: string; // target url
  phases: StressPhase[];
}

interface StressPhase {
  name: string; // phase name
  minClients: number; // arrival clients
  maxClients?: number; // will gradually continue instantiating after min clients started their scenario flow.
  rampDelayRate?: number; // configure speed of gradual clients. default: 100 (bigger = slower)
  scenarioInitializer?: StressScenarioInitializer; // a function that returns io client options. provided to authorize clients if needed.
  scenarioPath: string; // absolute of scenario file.
  scenarioTimeout?: number; // each client lifetime. default: no timeout.
}

type StressScenarioInitializer = (
  clientNumber: number, // starts from 0
) => Partial<ManagerOptions & SocketOptions>;
```

### Scenario

You're scenario files should export a function with this interface:

```typescript
type StressScenario = (
  socket: Socket, // connected io client
  logger: ILogger, // console.log won't work while executing scenario, use logger instead. You're logs will be saved to multiple files.
) => void | Promise<void>;

export interface ILogger {
  log: (message: string, type?: string) => void;
  error: (message: string | Error, type?: string) => void;
  warn: (message: string, type?: string) => void;
  debug: (message: string, type?: string) => void;
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> You're function has to call `socket.disconnect()` when your scenario execution is finished, otherwise iostress will wait for it all the time.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You can also terminate your phase scenario gracefully by pressing `t` key, and iostress will terminate all clients, and generate your report.
> - `Ctrl + C` will terminate all clients and iostress ungracefully.

## Report

Each phase will generate its own report file, in your project root folder with this pattern: `phase-name.report.json`.

### Report Schema

```typescript
interface StressReport {
  phase: string; // phase name
  testDuration: number; // phase duration in seconds
  connections: {
    attempted: number; // total clients attempted to connect
    successful: number; // successful connections
    failed: number; // failed connections
    averageConnectionTime: number; // average connection time in ms
    reconnectAttempts: number; // total reconnect attempts
  };
  events: {
    sent: number; // total events sent
    received: number; // total events received
    successful: number; // successful events (if provided acknowledgement function)
    failed: number; // failed events (if provided acknowledgement function)
    throughput: number; // events per second
  };
  latency: {
    average: number; // average latency in ms
    min: number; // min latency in ms
    max: number; // max latency in ms
    p50: number; // 50th percentile latency in ms
    p85: number; // 85th percentile latency in ms
    p95: number; // 95th percentile latency in ms
    p99: number; // 99th percentile latency in ms
  };
  errors: {
    total: number; // total errors
    byType: Record<string, number>; // errors count by defined types
  };
}
```
